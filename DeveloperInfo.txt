Bugs
----
2299458 - Korean translation is incomplete
2299507 - Unable to forward decrypted message as decrypted attachment
2299525 - Unable to decrypt attached encrypted message
2299563 - PGP options not restored in drafts - still unable to; posing on ComposeBackEnd??
2299636 - If encrypted message has associated TODO, then decrypting message masks TODO. Because can no longer make link from TODO to decrypted message?
2299681 - Decrypted message ends with gpgkeys error log
2299727 - when working offline, it may happen that a signature verification fails though signature is valid, in case there are attachments in message (except signature)
2299748 - "reply" mark is not set when you reply to a decrypted message from the singleMessageViewer only.
2299765 - "security header" not visible


FIXME (Leopard) No support for Time Machine: when navigating in Time Machine, PGP controls are not available, thus messages can't be decrypted.
FIXME Notice when GPGMail bundle has been installed in ~/Library and /Library -> avoid double-encryption
FIXME When performing keysearch, now that we use email+keyID, filter out keys that don't match keyID - special case when done automatically
FIXME When _receiving_ signed+encrypted message with attachment, GPGMail says it's unsigned
FIXME Multiple encrypted parts
TESTME Automatic decryption/verification - no deadlock? No.
FIXME HTML when no alternate
(FIXME Use key arrows in focussed decrypted message -> gets re-encrypted. Same when resizing window. But no problem when using page up/down buttons, nor space.) -- 10.5.5: seems OK
FIXME Sometimes a decrypted message is displayed in plain text instead of rich text - HOW TO REPRODUCE?
FIXME Crash when no secret key to decrypt, or cancelled password panel? Maybe automatic decryption? - HOW TO REPRODUCE?
FIXME Invalid signatures when contains all usenet sig + attachment?
FIXME Unable to decrypt encrypted attachments automatically - see Oct 23 2007
FIXME With autoverification ON, when receiving a junk signed message, the junk banner disappears when signature banner is displayed
TODO If HTML encrypted message misses plain text alternative, decode HTML and decrypt it?
BUG Crash or infinite loop with auto-decryption of encrypted PGP inline message with encrypted attachment.
BUG Invalid signature (or verification?) in PGP-MIME messages containing usenet ('-- ') signatures; works in PGP-inline messages
BUG Sometimes OpenPGP-signed messages are generated with 2 empty lines after the 'Content-Type: multipart/alternative', instead of one, and some mail servers remove one of the empty lines, thus invalidating message signature - see Jim Syler, Mar 7 2006
SOLVED Stack trace logs in console, due to MailTags; these exceptions are normally thrown and caught by GPGMail


? PENDING BUG: Was returning a "No data" error WITHOUT decrypting data when decrypting message which was also signed, and key was not available, AND automatic key search WAS enabled. If no automatic search, then decrypts but warns it is missing key. -> correct gpgme first; asked bug-gpgme.
??? Better problem reporting when using RSA key (signing) (GPGMail#2071+2244)
? Panther: disable S/MIME signing and encryption when PGP signing or encryption is enabled. GPGMail#2256
TODO Use all known keyservers when verifying/searching
? "General Error" when using "by default use OpenPGP-MIME"? GPGMail#2297 - Unable to reproduce; similar to other problem GPGMail#2071?? Main key was missing uid.
BUG installer: sometimes the OS9 Mail is launched instead -> use com.apple.mail as app

New FAQ: How to remove undesired keys?
New FAQ: Internal error: *** subrange... -> multiple encrypted parts

New FAQ: Some mail servers break OpenPGP-signed messages by reordering some header contents (Wannadoo or .mac) - see G. Pineau, Mar 8 2006

? KNOWN BUG: GPGMail doesn't support signing with RSA keys (old PGP keys).

? Crash in gpgme:gpgme_op_keylist_start(); GPGMail#2418; seems it's a low memory condition crash
? NEW FEATURE: after encryption failure due to missing keys, user can now select to send unencrypted to missing keys, and encrypted to keys -> multiple messages
? Crash in gpgme:keylist_colon_handler(); GPGMail#2465 - forwarded to Markus Brinkmann
? NEW FEATURE: send owner's key
? NEW FEATURE: combine decrypt & verify menus/buttons, because only one can be active at the same time
? New: use .pkg and modify defaults for all users, in /Library/Preferences/ (see GPGMail#...)
? NEW FEATURE: add possibility to disable GPGMail (reenabled in prefs)
? BUG GPGMail#2112: after decryption, banner shows verification state, not signature/error state!!! Key's not found.
? BUG: invalid sig in discuss-gnustep#4362
? 8bits chars are now allowed in SMTP -> remove assertions, if any, but only on receiving, because Mail still uses 7bit (except bug)
? NEW: for passphrase timeout in prefs, use special widget
? New: when reading clear-text PGP messages, use "Charset" PGP header when present. When encrypting, create that header. See RFC2440. Default is UTF-8.
? NEW: display keyID in long format
? NEW: when has only expired keys, suggest user to search for new key
? NEW: use text attachments to display more info about keys, e.g. in sig verif view display an icon next to signer to show trust. Do it wherever possible.
? BUG: some messages can't be verified by gpg 1.4, but are OK with gpg 1.2; see R. Goldsmith's messages. Related to new way of doing in gpg 1.4 AND bug (unstripped tailing spaces in messages) in GPGMail; new option in gpg 1.4.1

TODO Tolerate non RFC3156 hash algo, but warn user (and allow changing algo)
TODO Refactoring of prefs: regroup by theme, remove some? See Robert's email (encryptAll should be fully replaced by encryptWhenPossible?)
TODO In pref pane, add reference (+link?) to ABKey plug-in
TODO Add "Sign when recipients know PGP" (i.e. when there are PGP public keys for recipients)
TODO In key chooser, add new column 'Additional Info' that shows 'expired', 'revoked', etc.
TODO In key chooser, add new column ownertrust
TODO Review key chooser: make non modal, in panel; user can search for keys (search field like for address panel), display lot of info, D&D(?), and pass selected keys to mainWindow -> can choose for encryption, for export

v39
TODO In menu items, mark in red revoked/expired keys
(TODO Encryption progress panel: make it a sheet.) Impossible, because window is no longer displayed
BUG Invalid (created?) signatures when format=flowed in MIME(really??); needs gpg 1.4.1 special option (which one??) to avoid that.
BUG If AB entry says 'encrypt' or 'MIME' but there's no (valid or not) PGP key, ignore option
TODO Use the headers to show signature information?
TODO Show ownertrust info, with warning sign when owner not trusted
TODO Add option to automatically remove inline PGP signatures in replies.
BUG in Cocoa 10.4.2: impossible to type passphrase with composed characters, e.g. acute accent and e; no problem when keyboard provides accented character in one key press
TODO Disable S/MIME on a per-message basis, e.g. when PGP encryption/signing is on
BUG Automatic decryption fails often: still displays encrypted message
TODO Use Smart Crash Report (10.4 only?) -> create SOPE app
BUG Private key is actually unselected when it seems to be selected -> user might be unable to encrypt anything, due to rules
TODO In pref pane, add 'export config' button to gather GPGMail userDefaults
TODO No longer hide unusable keys, but explain why they are unusable, and prevent automatic choice
BUG GPGMail not invoked when message created automatically by rule (because no UI) -> should provide applescript, or intercept the delivery
TODO New toolbar button showing key caching state - clicking it clears cache (valid only for memory cache, not keychain)
TODO Warn when replying/forwarding unencrypted to encrypted message
(TODO Auto-decrypt when passphrase is in cache) -- unable to know that with gpg-agent
TODO New pref to not even show passphrase-disclosure checkbox in passphrase panel
TODO When showing signed message, display image in signer's key (if any) instead of sender's image (if any), with PGP icon/cert/padlock on it
(TODO New mailbundle for PGP timestamping service (http://www.itconsult.co.uk/stamper/stampinf.htm)) No longer active? Very old.
TODO Modify smart addresses tokens to display a PGP icon, when there is a key for the user; add PGP menu items too to the token popup menu - see AddressAttachment
BUG/TODO Signature encapsulation is done only for OpenPGP/MIME, not for inline-PGP - either implement it, or change tooltip in prefs
BUG Still too many gpg operations to retrieve keys: why is cache not used?
BUG Even reloading keys doesn't recognize new private keys?
TODO Automatic rules diagnosis available for user, i.e. display user all evaluated criteria
TODO In keyserver list, display which server is main, and allow user to change main.
TODO After user downloaded new keys, if current message failed to verify, relaunch message verification
TODO Toolbar button to toggle MIME/inline (when possible)
(TODO Can we now use progress info when encrypting? Not yet implemented with gpg 1.4.8/gpgme 1.4)
TODO When BCC is used and BCC keys are not in non-BCC keys, then issue warning; also, change the pref to simply turn off that warning.
BUG Sometimes OpenPGP-signed messages are generated with 2 empty lines after the 'Content-Type: multipart/alternative', instead of one, and some mail servers remove one of the empty lines, thus invalidating message signature - see Jim Syler, Mar 7 2006

Following entries should be checked: are these still bugs in v1.2.0? Maybe they are simply duplicates of existing bugs.
    GPGMail tells decrypted messages are not signed, even when they are; you need to perform validation manually, using toolbar button or menu.
    When arrow keys are used to navigate through messages, decrypted messages appear encrypted again. Same problem when resizing window.
    On Leopard, sometimes validation of valid signature fails, when there is an attachment
    Toolbar buttons are sometimes duplicated, when you have multiple viewers.
    Toolbar buttons are sometimes lost or moved.
    Appearance of encrypted mail attachments changes over time.
    Returns error "No data" when cannot find missing signature key from key server, instead of telling which key cannot be found
    Do not set message viewers splitview to a too small height, else PGP part becomes unreadable.
    When decrypting a signed and encrypted message whose signer's key cannot be found, returns a "No data" error without decrypting message, if automatic key retrieval is enabled.
    Does not support RSA keys for signing/encrypting (no problem when receiving a message)
    Sometimes GPGMail fails to verify messages with <code>format=flowed</code>
    Sometimes GPGMail fails to verify messages containing usenet signatures
    When working offline, it may happen that a signature verification fails though signature is valid, in case there are attachments in message (except signature)


? OT: Charly's extras: detachable mailbox panel - keyboard shortcuts for rule creation - ability to add additional headers (x-...)
